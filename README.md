# About me
### Good day, Sir/Madam. My name is Ooi Cheng Jie, and I am currently residing in Malaysia, a country neighboring to Singapore. I am a software engineer specializing in web application development.

### Allow me to provide a brief overview of my background. I have accumulated 8 years of industrial experience, primarily in software development and research and development (R&D). In my previous role at Intel Malaysia, PG12, I worked on graphics drivers for Fedora 14, Meego 1.2, and Windows Embedded Compact 7. During these 8 years, I have developed a strong technical skill set and a deep understanding of software development. This experience has enabled me to work effectively both as part of a team and independently. I also possess strong communication skills, which have allowed me to collaborate successfully with individuals at all levels within organizations. As the person in charge of projects, I have directly engaged with stakeholders, clients, and vendors. My flexibility and adaptability in project management have consistently enabled me to deliver high-quality outcomes that meet client satisfaction.

### Having me in this position offers not only technical expertise but also the potential for further collaboration that can open up opportunities in both the Malaysian and Singaporean markets. With my familiarity with the Asian environment and proficiency in multiple languages, including English, Malay, Indonesian, and Chinese, I am capable of reading, writing, speaking, and communicating effectively in these languages. I consider these linguistic abilities as valuable assets.  

# Technical Skills
### I possess a robust skill set that is substantiated by my sample portfolio. This portfolio encompasses a variety of websites with diverse objectives, including e-commerce, business, F&B, real estate, education, sports, logistics, services, finance, point of sale, and more. These projects collectively serve as a testament to my proficiency in web development.
### My expertise spans across both frontend and backend technologies:
### Frontend: Reactjs, Nextjs, Angularjs, Vuejs, Gatsby, bootstrap, tailwindcss, typescript, material ui, chakra ui, semantic ui, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, SASS, Redux, GraphQL, etc.  
### Backend: Node.js, express.js, mongodb, snipcart, sanity, python, mongo, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, java, maven, hibernate, shopify V2, wordpress, Django, Firebase, contentful, prism, payment integration API (Stripe, Paypal, Braintree, etc) and so on.
### I'm also proficient in dockernization and deployment, and I can containerize and deploy web applications to the paid cloud hosting services like Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Heroku, and more if access is provided. (I cancelled the earlier subscription due to the monthly cluster charging for inactive usage)
### As a developer, I am familiar with version controlling tool, Linux operating system, and visual studio. I could have the design Figma, Adobe XD, PSD) conversion to the static page/landing page. 

# Soft skills
### Multi-lingual oral and written communication, time management, persuasion, creativity, collaboration, flexibility, project coordination, adaptability and team work.

# Work Practise
### Let me talk a bit about my work practices. As someone working in software development, I follow a common practice, much like other software engineers. I don't typically use the latest package unless there is a specific demand from the client. Instead, I usually opt for stable builds that were released within the past one or two years. Why? Because the latest build is still undergoing the software development life cycle, where possible bugs are being detected during integration. This requires additional effort to fix. On the other hand, for stable earlier builds (non-deprecated), the initial bugs have already been identified and resolved. If I encounter any issues, I am able to work with the package developer for follow-up and escalation
### I can perform software testing to ensure the quality assurance of the application if there are sufficient resources allocated for these tasks. I can also prepare unit tests, functionality tests, blackbox testing, and test cases.
