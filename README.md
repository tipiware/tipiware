# Work Practise
### Let me talk a bit about my work practices. As  someone doing software development, I have a common practice just like other software engineer, which I don’t really used the latest package unless there is a specific demand from client.  I usually use stable build that were released within one/two years. Why? This is because latest build is undergoing software development life cycle, where there are possibles bugs being detected during integration. It requires additional effort to fix it. While for the stable earlier build(non-depreciated), the earlier bugs have been escalated and fixed. If I have encountered any issues, I am able to work with package developer on following up/escalation.
