# About me
### Good day, Sir/Madam. My name is Cheng Jie, and I am currently residing in Malaysia, a country neighboring Singapore. I am a software engineer specializing in web application development.

### Allow me to provide a brief overview of my background. I have accumulated 8 years of industrial experience, primarily in software development and research and development (R&D). In my previous role at Intel Malaysia, PG12, I worked on graphics drivers for Fedora 14, Meego 1.2, and Windows Embedded Compact 7. During these 8 years, I have developed a strong technical skill set and a deep understanding of software development. This experience has enabled me to work effectively both as part of a team and independently. I also possess strong communication skills, which have allowed me to collaborate successfully with individuals at all levels within organizations. As the person in charge of projects, I have directly engaged with stakeholders, clients, and vendors. My flexibility and adaptability in project management have consistently enabled me to deliver high-quality outcomes that meet client satisfaction.

### Having me in this position offers not only technical expertise but also the potential for further collaboration that can open up opportunities in both the Malaysian and Singaporean markets. With my familiarity with the Asian environment and proficiency in multiple languages, including English, Malay, Indonesian, and Chinese, I am capable of reading, writing, speaking, and communicating effectively in these languages. I consider these linguistic abilities as valuable assets

# Work Practise
### Let me talk a bit about my work practices. As  someone doing software development, I have a common practice just like other software engineer, which I donâ€™t really used the latest package unless there is a specific demand from client.  I usually use stable build that were released within one/two years. Why? This is because latest build is undergoing software development life cycle, where there are possibles bugs being detected during integration. It requires additional effort to fix it. While for the stable earlier build(non-depreciated), the earlier bugs have been escalated and fixed. If I have encountered any issues, I am able to work with package developer on following up/escalation.
